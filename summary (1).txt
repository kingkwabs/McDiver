Time spent on the assignment, in hours: 5-6 hours

Implementation strategy:
    (describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.) I started implementing the helper methods and the data structures first. Then I moved on the heavy hitters like the algos and later optimized everything after I got things to work consistently.

Testing strategy:
    (how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?)
 For data structures I created graphs that covered most cases. For the actual game, I rand through multiple seeds in headless mode to test my optimizations.

Known problems:
    (are there any things that do not work?)
Nothing that I know of.

Comments on the assignment:
This was a difficult assignment, But I did enjoy the game aspect of it.
